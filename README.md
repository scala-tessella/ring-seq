# `ring-vector`
Extends immutable `Vector` with ring (circular) methods.

## Need
Whenever data are better described by a circular collection,
you don't want to locally reinvent the wheel 😉.

## Solution
`ring-vector` is a small, self-contained library,
where most of the circular use cases are already solved
and building blocks provided for the others.

One possible idea has been to create a dedicated collection.
But the differences with `Vector` are few,
so a Scala3 `extension` seems a better fit.

## Methods

### Circular version of existing ones

### Rotation and reflection

### Symmetry
