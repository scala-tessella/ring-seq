# RingSeq

A library that adds new operations to Scala `Seq`
for when a sequence needs to be considered [**circular**](what-is.html),
its elements forming a ring.

It works on any immutable / mutable `Seq` and sub-types.

Available for Scala `3.1.1` and `2.13.8`.

## Setup

Add the following dependency to your `build.sbt` file:

@@@vars
~~~ scala
libraryDependencies += "io.github.scala-tessella" %% "ring-seq" % "$project.version$"
~~~
@@@

## Getting started

First, start with the following import:

```scala
import io.github.scala_tessella.ring_seq.RingSeq._
```

Where the [`RingSeq`](https://github.com/scala-tessella/ring-seq/blob/master/src/main/scala/io/github/scala_tessella/ring_seq/RingSeq.scala) object is imported, any collection under `Seq`
will access the new methods. You can write something like:

```scala
"RING".rotateRight(1).mkString // GRIN
List(0, 1, 2, 3).startAt(2) // List(2, 3, 0, 1)
ListBuffer(1, 3, 5, 7, 9).reflectAt(3) // ListBuffer(7, 5, 3, 1, 9)
```

## Need
Whenever data are structured in a circular sequence,
chances are you don't want to locally reinvent the wheel (pun intended).

## Solution
**RingSeq** is a small, purely functional, self-contained library,
where most of the circular use cases are already solved
and building blocks provided for the others.

Leveraging Scala [`implicit class`](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/implicit-classes.html),
it acts like a _decorator_,
providing new circular methods to any collection under `Seq`.
